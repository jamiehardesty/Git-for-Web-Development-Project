Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
            A block element takes the full width available, and an inline element appears on the same line hence the name.

            The element would be positioned relative to its parent, similar to how position:fixed places an element relative to the viewport.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
            min-width
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
            Block:  
                    1. <main>
                    2. <nav>
                    3. <footer>
            Inline: 
                    1. <a>
                    2. <span>
            Inline-block:
                    1. <button>, <select>
